# Exercism Repository


## When i started my internship at CI&t, we had a month to practice the language that we were going to work with, so i practice with execises from exercism, most of them are in JAVA.

### To run any of those projects you need to have installed:
- IntelliJ (because some of the folders are designed to run better on this IDE)
- Gradle (to run the tests 'gradle test')

## Some of the cool exercises that i did:

1. [Matrix](https://github.com/WagnerCaetano/exercismRepository/tree/master/Java/matrix) - Given a string representing a matrix of numbers, return the rows and columns of that matrix.

2. [Series](https://github.com/WagnerCaetano/exercismRepository/tree/master/Java/series) - Given a string of digits, output all the contiguous substrings of length n in that string in the order that they appear.

3. [Queen Attack](https://github.com/WagnerCaetano/exercismRepository/tree/master/Java/queen-attack) - Given the position of two queens on a chess board, indicate whether or not they are positioned so that they can attack each other.

4. [Diamond](https://github.com/WagnerCaetano/exercismRepository/tree/master/Java/diamond) - The diamond kata takes as its input a letter, and outputs it in a diamond shape. Given a letter, it prints a diamond starting with 'A', with the supplied letter at the widest point.

5. [Rail Fence Cipher](https://github.com/WagnerCaetano/exercismRepository/tree/master/Java/rail-fence-cipher) - The Rail Fence cipher is a form of transposition cipher that gets its name from the way in which it's encoded. It was already used by the ancient Greeks.
